        <h2>What is Web Pantry</h2>
        <p>Web Pantry is an ongoing project designed to make it easier to decide what to eat. Tell us what you have on 
            hand, and we will suggest recipes and what ingredients, if any, you need to buy.
            Web Pantry can help eliminate food waste by prioritizing recipes that use ingredients that expire soon.
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
            Fill up your pantry by selecting ingredients that you have on hand. If you don't want to be too specific, 
            (or just to save time), 
            you can select the category titles to add all items in that category to your pantry. Next, you'll have the 
            option to mark ingredients that expire soon to find recipes that use those specific ingredients. Then, just pick 
            a recipe and get cooking!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also help out by adding your own recipes for people to use. Be sure to add all the ingredients in the 
            ingredients list, as well as any substitutions. The more substitutions, the more people can use your recipes.
            <em>To do: make some sort of reward system for adding recipes?</em>
