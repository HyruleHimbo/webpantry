        <div class="about"><p class="ahead">What is Web Pantry</p>
        <p>Web Pantry is an ongoing project designed to make 
            deciding what to eat easier. Web Pantry can help eliminate 
            food waste by allowing you to select what ingredients expire 
            when, saving that information, and then suggesting recipes that use
            them. If a recipe requires something you don't have, it will also
            offer substitutions.
        </p>
        <p class="subhead">How it works</p>
        <p>
            Select the ingredients that you want to use so that Web Pantry can sort 
            through recipes that use those ingredients. Next, you have the option to 
            select what other ingredients you have at your disposal. If you 
            choose to skip this step, WP will assume that you have or are willing to buy 
            the remaining ingredients. Be sure to select 
            "Do not suggest other ingredients"
             if you only want to include the ingredients 
            you have selected (no last minute trip to the grocery store).
        </p>
        <p>This is a work-in-progress and I'm not getting
            paid to do this. I'm literally just making this for me but if 
            you wanna use it that's fine just no complaining if it sucks
